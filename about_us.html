myVariable=<br>Never Too Late is a bluegrass gospel group dedicated to playing in prisons.  We pass out Bibles, spread the good news in word and music.  We believe that all men and women should hear about the gospel of Jesus Christ.  We believe the Lord has called us into this ministry.  We have been going into prisons since the year 2000.  Our group is non-profit so donations can be taken as tax deductions.  100 percent of CD sales goes into the ministry.  Help us carry the gospel into the prisons.
