<icon image="icon2.png" tooltip="Rubik's Cube" content="Rubik's Cube is a mechanical puzzle invented in 1974 by the Hungarian sculptor and professor of architecture Erno Rubik. The plastic cube comes in four different versions: the 222 (Pocket Cube), the 333, the 444 (Rubik's Revenge), and the 555 (Professor's Cube). The 333 version, which is the version usually meant by the term Rubik's Cube, has nine square faces on each side, for a total area of fifty-four faces, and occupies the volume of twenty-seven unit cubes. Typically, the faces of the Cube are covered by stickers in six solid colours, one for each side of the Cube. When the puzzle is solved, each side of the Cube is a solid colour. The original 333 version celebrated its twenty-fifth anniversary in 2005, when a special edition Cube in a presentation box was released, featuring a sticker in the center of the white face with a Rubik's Cube 1980-2005 logo." />

<icon image="icon3.png" tooltip="Widgets" content="A widget (or control) is an interface component that a computer user interacts with, such as a window or a text box. Widgets are sometimes qualified as virtual to distinguish them from their physical counterparts, e.g. virtual buttons that can be clicked with a mouse cursor, vs. physical buttons that can be pressed with a finger. Widgets are often packaged together in widget toolkits. Programmers use widgets to build graphical user interfaces (GUIs)." />

<icon image="icon4.png" tooltip="Trash Can" content="A waste container (known more commonly in British English as a dustbin and American English as a trash can) is a container, which can be made out of metal or plastic,[1] used to store refuse. Other names include rubbish bin, litter bin, trash barrel, garbage can and trash bin. Indoor bins are traditionally kept in the kitchen[2] to dispose of culinary excess such as fruit peelings or food packets, although there are also wastepaper baskets or wastebaskets which are used in offices to dispose of waste paper and other office refuse.Most bins have lids on the top to seal in the odor that trash tends to emit. Though most have to be opened manually, indoor bins sometimes have pedals which open the lid when stepped on." />

<icon image="icon5.png" tooltip="Compass" content="A compass (or mariner's compass) is a navigational instrument for finding directions on the earth. It consists of a magnetised pointer free to align itself accurately with Earth's magnetic field, which is of great assistance in navigation. The cardinal points are north, south, east and west. A compass can be used in conjunction with a clock and a sextant to provide a very accurate navigation capability. This device greatly improved maritime trade by making travel safer and more efficient. The compass was developed in China more than seventeen hundred years ago, however the original inventor remains in dispute; legend has it was invented by emperor Huang Di." />

<icon image="icon6.png" tooltip="Toaster" content="Modern toasters are typically one of two varieties: pop-up toasters and toaster ovens.In pop-up toasters, the bread is inserted vertically into slots (generally only large enough to admit a single slice of bread) on the top of the toaster. A lever on the side of the toaster is depressed, activating the toaster. When an internal device determines that the toasting cycle is complete, the toaster turns off and the toast pops up out of the slots. The heating elements of a pop-up toaster are oriented vertically, parallel to the bread. By comparison, toaster ovens are small electric ovens with a door on one side and a tray within. To toast bread with a toaster oven, one lays down slices of bread horizontally on the tray, closes the door, and activates the toaster, usually by means of a lever. When the toast is done, the toaster turns off, but the door must be opened manually. Toaster ovens are capable of performing most of the functions of ordinary ovens, but on a much smaller scale." />

<icon image="icon7.png" tooltip="Can of SPAM" content="Spam is a canned meat product made by the Hormel Foods Corporation in (among other places) Austin, Minnesota, USA (aka Spam Town USA). Although Spam is simply a meat product, it has gained a peculiar infamy out of all proportion for a mere grocery store item, and has even entered into folklore and legend. The labeled ingredients in the original variety of Spam are chopped pork shoulder meat with ham meat added, salt, water, sugar, and sodium nitrite. Other varieties of Spam differ; Spam Lite contains pork and chicken, and Spam Oven Roasted Turkey is a halaal food, meaning that it is allowed under Islamic law, and is especially popular in Muslim markets. It also comes in a low-salt variety." />

<icon image="icon8.png" tooltip="Apple iMac" content="The iMac is a desktop computer designed and built by Apple Computer. It has been the consumer flagship of Apple's Macintosh range since 1998, and has evolved through three basic forms. It has been rated by Walt Mossberg as the Gold Standard of desktop computing. The iMac has been a huge innovation that, along with the introduction of the iPod, has contributed to the recent dramatic increase in Apple Computer's profits and share price. Some credit the popularity of the USB devices to the iMac, as Windows PCs previously supported legacy ports, which reduced the incentive for third-party manufacturers to produce USB-compliant devices." />

<icon image="icon9.png" tooltip="Apple iPod" content="The iPod is a brand of portable media players designed and marketed by Apple Computer. Devices in the iPod family provide a simple user interface designed around a central scroll wheel (with the exception of the iPod shuffle). The full-sized model stores media on a built-in hard drive, while the smaller iPod shuffle and iPod nano use flash memory. Like many digital audio players, iPods can serve as external data storage devices when connected to a computer.

<icon image="icon10.png" tooltip="Terminal Window" content="A data terminal, text terminal, or often just terminal (sometimes text console) is a serial computer interface for text entry and display. Original text terminals were electronic computer terminals connected to computers by a serial line, but later computers have built-in system consoles, and terminal emulator programs that work in a graphical desktop environment. Graphical displays have not eradicated the text terminal as it is convenient for computer programmers and appropriate for command-line interfaces and text user interfaces. Most programming languages support standard streams for inputting and printing text, and it is simplest to connect the streams to a text terminal." />
